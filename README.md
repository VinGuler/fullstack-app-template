# Full Stack App Template

This is a template project, having the basics of most fullstack web apps.<br />
I am in the process of updating this and making it work for more variations, and keeping it as abstract as possible.
<br />
<br />
READEME file is attached to each part of the app.
<br />
Currently supporting:

<ul>
<li>Vue.js client side</li>
<li>Node.js server side</li>
</ul>
<br />
Feel free to use :smile:
